Advanced Software Engineering Team Project

VirgilPlus is a software that makes course planning effortless for students.  Whereas currently students have to browse through an entire catalog that contains mostly irrelevant or unavailable courses, VirgilPlus lets students bypass the frustration of picking out the courses right for them.  In particular, given a set of courses that a student has already taken and a set of preferences such as graduation year, day of the week or time window, VirgilPlus outputs the courses that fit these constraints up to a threshold, and eases the process of choosing desired courses
